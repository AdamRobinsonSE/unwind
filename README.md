A fully responsive and beautiful website to track which bourbons you've had and love.

## Link to project 

This is a WIP. The basic functionality is there and its my take on a bourbon version of untapped. I'm not much of a beer guy - but I would love a spot to track which bourbons I've had and what my friends have. You can add bourbons, delete them, comment on them, and see a fee of other users and what bourbons they've submitted. There is a lot of styling to be done (see below!), as well as more functionality to add. 

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node, Express, MongoDB, React (currently is EJS, switching this out)

## Optimizations

1. Ability to add your friends and see what they've had.
2. Ability to add a bourbon to a list of ones to keep an eye out for.
3. Ability to say where you had it or where you purchased it.
4. Ability to edit your bourbon check-in
4. Search functionality to see what you've had and what friends have had. 
4. Endless styling!
